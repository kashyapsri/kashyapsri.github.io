Disclaimer: This is my very first post ever and the views in this post are of my own. Feel free to ping me to have a chat. :)

If you don't already know, every Indian parent would expect a good grade from their kids. But funnily, my dad only used to ask me which class I was in because he often forgets it. My high-school days are one of the best moments in my life, only later in my life did I realize that playing outdoor games for 3 hours every day is a luxury that many kids in India these days don't have. The best lessons that I have from school are the interests that I gained and the fun of playing out-doors. I am so glad that I didn't have to go for some IIT coaching at the cost of my play time. 
We were never educated about the path that we need to take to become a professional apart from (Engineering/Medicine). I had no idea how cool it would be a Pilot/Architect. Isn't that lame? One must rely on their relatives or mutual friends to find out about the future prospects of different careers. I strongly believe that students in 10th standard should have several guest lectures from professionals in various fields. At least then they will have something to think about. 
And sadly 11th and 12th class are some of the worst things a kid has to go through in India. These are probably the two years that spoiled my health more than any other time in my life, however, it did get me into a decent college. Was that suffering worth it? No, For sure. Getting into Engineering field is just one of the many options. Logically, many students take up Engineering because it has a potential of getting paid more. I hope that many of my generation would start new companies which will enable more options to the future generation. 

To give you an example, I am comparing my internship experience in Honeywell in Bangalore vs Varex Imaging in SLC, USA. Along with me, all the other interns in Honeywell were in some Engineering domain. Just so you know, Honeywell is one of the best electronic product design companies in Bangalore. All the interns, including me were assigned unique roles. But, if you really try to get a high-level overview, most of us were doing service-related work. It's some support that we provide to the companies overseas. It's nothing that is conceptualized, designed, and headed by the team in India. 
On the other side, Varex hired a bunch of students, and only less than half of them are Engineers. The rest are from finance, accounting, marketing, sales, and strategy and so on. And the few engineers that are here, have design roles and these are the students that are passionate about their work. It's not because they copy in their 10th class, 12 class, paid donation to some Engineering college, hired some agency to write their LoRs and SoPS (I know there are people who are doing well who take the other career path as well). And all Engineers/Non-Engineers were paid the same.

You see the difference? Having the headquarters in the homeland enables us to have better positions, better opportunities. It also enables the students who copy in their school, college to have some other roles that they may be naturally good at.
So, next time if you want to inspire your little cousin, tell them how cool it is to be an entrepreneur. Maybe there is some chance that they would take up that adventure.

I have the utmost respect from people who start new companies in India. Considering the hardships that they must go through, and the offers that they resign to take up that challenge and the some of the major beneficiaries are the people around them. 

Final thoughts - We have the potential to make a significant difference to our society if we start to think differently about education and put more efforts. Grades are some small part of the Kid's performace and maybe try to learn more about the kid before you ask for their grades. Instead, test them on their grasping power or try to complement their natural talents if you can figure it out.
