- Implemented a 5 staged pipelined, superscalar LC4 processor using Verilog in Xilinx Zynq 7000 SoC
- Performed bypassing to handle the data hazards, optimized the pipelines to close the timing requirement at 66 MHz

- Developed a compressor to receive data in real time and compress into memory using deduplication and compression
- Implemented a 5-stage pipeline for deduplication to run on the multiple ARM CPU cores using NEON intrinsics
- Accelerated the compression algorithm and achieved a throughput of 48 Mbps using on-chip FPGA

## Hardware Accelerator for Machine Learning using FPGAs

- Devised an FPGA-accelerated convolutional layer for accelerating DCNN using AWS F1 instance
- Integrated the kernel into Pytorch using C++ extensions and built the host code using OpenCL API
- Explored the design space using multiple kernels and out of order queue techniques to achieve comparable speed up with single core CPU

<!-- Transmitter & Receiver Chain Design using ADS

- Designed RF transmitter chain consisting of SSA, PA at 7 GHz with a gain of 24 dB and PAE of 25% using Keysight ADS
- Realized LNA with a noise figure of 1.34 dB and gain of 7 dB at 7 GHz, direction coupler with insertion loss less than 0.4 dB and 10 dB coupling using Keysight ADS and AWR -->
